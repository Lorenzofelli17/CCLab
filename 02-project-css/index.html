    <h3>Appereance</h3>
    <p>This creature manifests as a series of oscillating lines and circles across a digital canvas. Its colors
        shift
        dynamically, creating a mesmerizing visual effect that changes over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oscillation: The creature's primary mode of movement is through sine and cosine wave-based oscillations.
        </li>
        <li>Color Change: It changes color over time, with its colors inversely related to the background, creating
            a
            vibrant contrast.</li>
        <li> Interactivity: Its amplitude and speed change based on interaction with the digital environment,
            specifically
            mouse movements and clicks.</li>
        <li>Adaptability: It can reset its position and adjust its speed randomly when interacted with, showing a
            form
            of
            digital adaptability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>what do we know so far about the creatures?</h3>

    <h3>How do we interact with this creature?</h3>
    <p>Mouse Movement: Moving the mouse changes the amplitude of the creature's oscillations and the size of the
        circles
        it generates.
        Mouse Click: Clicking within the digital habitat resets the creature's position and alters its speed,
        providing
        a random element to its movement patterns.
