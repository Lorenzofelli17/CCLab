                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>
                    This creature manifests as a series of oscillating lines and circles across a digital canvas. Its
                    colors shift dynamically, creating a mesmerizing visual effect that changes over time.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oscillation: The creature's primary mode of movement is through sine and cosine wave-based
                        oscillations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Color Change: It changes color over time, with its colors inversely related to the background,
                        creating a vibrant contrast.</li>
                    <li>Adaptability: It can reset its position and adjust its speed randomly when interacted with,
                        showing a form of digital adaptability.</li>
                    <li>Interactivity: Its amplitude and speed change based on interaction with the digital environment,
                        specifically mouse movements and clicks
                    </li>

                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>

                Everyone is familiar with blood cells, but few have considered interacting with them in a playful
                manner. During my time in the Interactive Media Arts (IMA) Lab at NYU Shanghai, I encountered several
                games, one of which intriguingly simulated blood cell movement. This experience inspired me to develop a
                concept showcasing how blood cells travel through our system in response to heart rate variations.
                Essentially, as the heart rate increases, the blood cells accelerate, and concurrently, the lungs
                expand, illustrating a dynamic physiological process.

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Mouse Movement: Moving the mouse changes the amplitude of the creature's oscillations and the size
                    of the circles it generates </li>
                <li>Mouse Click: Clicking within the digital habitat resets the creature's position and alters its
                    speed, providing a random element to its movement patterns</li>
